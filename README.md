# For Development

This is an open project not aimed for commercial use, so feel free to fork your own copy and build upon the features provided here. This is not a constantly maintained repository besides updating dependencies. Alternatively feel free to submit a report for any issues found and I will judge on the scope of the issue whether to fix.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
